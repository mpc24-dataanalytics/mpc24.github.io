  <p>Michael Cary, PHD, RN, joined the DUSON faculty in August, 2012. 
    My name is Michael Cary and I am an Assistant Professor at the Duke University School of Nursing. 
    My research program focuses on improving health outcomes of older adults who use post-acute care services (e.g., Inpatient Rehabilitation, Skilled Nursing Facilities) due an injury and/or worsening illness with an emphasis on identification of risk management, quality measurement, and care coordination.     
    
    
</p>
  <p>I have over 10 years of nursing experience in long-term care, rehabilitation, and community health settings. 
    I earned a BS in health services administration with a double minor in business administration and health information systems from James Madison University, and his BSN and MSN degrees (health systems management concentration) from the University of Virginia. 
    He also completed his PhD in Nursing at University of Virginia School of Nursing with a focus on the use of large secondary datasets to 
    study outcomes among older adult hip fracture patients treated in post-acute rehabilitation settings. .</p>
